Seem to be only catching anomalies in the context of a known substructure. Outside those
structures, GBAD is not providing good feedback (many false negatives). These false negatives
occur even in cases that ought to be trivial. Say a process graph always terminates ABCD,
but for only 2/200 traces, terminates ABEM. EM is obviously an anomaly, but since it didn't
occur within the context of an anomaly, it wasnt caught.

Get back to Eberle; diagnose GBAD segfault.

Is there another parameter to gbad-prob to help discover insertions, besides the prob param?
Can mdl or mps be forced to recurse on discovered substructure?
Why does GBAD not catch EM? See SandboxData/DifficultLog3. Would recursive subdue work? See gbad-prob log. Why is E not caught, given it occurs in only 2 instances?
**Why does EM have the substructure value it does, even though it belongs to only 2 instances?
Would recursive subdue work to detect anomalies?
Think of substructures as a terrain map: GBAD discovering the most trivial elements of a graph first. Innermost (best) substructure is first, then
a tree of sbustructures form off of this one. Consolidate the by level; sort by compression value.

Anomaly wrt the substructure.
Constrain substructure to contain START -> .... -> END

1) Why is gbad p not scoring the EM edge as anomalous?
2) Can iterative subdue find the anomaly?
3 Constraining subdue to include START and END: loop condition in code (dont allow any substracture unless it include both START and END), seed subs with START and END,
or seed with all prevalent paths from start to finish

Goals:
1) compress and iterate
2) seed subdue or otherwise constrain subdue to include both START and END
